# 4all - Front-end test

## Project

This project will be a clothing store called **STI Store**, which will be based on some existing stores.
The inspirations for this project are:

- [Kanui](https://www.kanui.com.br/);
- [Lacoste](https://www.lacoste.com/br/);
- [Renner](https://www.lojasrenner.com.br/);
- [Netshoes](https://www.netshoes.com.br/);
  The premise of the store would be something aimed at a younger audience with affordable clothes and a lot of sales based on promotions, as for example in [Kanui](https://www.kanui.com.br/), but with a more _clean_ visual footprint, like e-commerce from [Lacoste](https://www.lacoste.com/br/).

## UI

For this project, a _Low Fidelity_ UI was created, with the thought of having a north for the programming to follow, below the images:

and in relation to the final visual concept of e-commerce, I will be based on another project of my own, which is also called **STI Store**, that so far is in UI development, [Link para o projeto em desenvolvimento.](https://github.com/GabrielStima/stistore), and because of that I will use the same color system:
